# Document 1: Engineering Best Practices for WebSynth Studio

### 1. Code Quality & Standards

- **Language:** TypeScript for type-safety.
- **Linting & Formatting:** ESLint + Prettier with consistent rules enforced in CI.
- **Code Style:** Functional React components with hooks, modularized helpers for audio DSP.
- **Commit Standards:** Conventional Commits (`feat:`, `fix:`, `chore:`).

### 2. Architecture & Structure

- **Project Structure:**
    ```
    /src
      /audio-engine   → Web Audio / DSP logic
      /ui             → React components (controls, patch cables, keyboard)
      /state          → State management with Redux Toolkit or Zustand
      /patches        → Preset JSON storage
    ```
- **Separation of Concerns:**
    - Audio engine (pure JS/TS, testable, deterministic).
    - UI layer (React, visuals only).
    - State layer (patch data, routing, persistence).

### 3. Testing

- **Unit Tests:**
    - Jest for logic, especially audio routing/maths.
    - Test Envelope (ADSR) and Oscillator frequency match expected values.
- **UI Tests:**
    - React Testing Library for component behavior.
    - Cypress or Playwright for end-to-end flows (e.g., save/load a patch).

### 4. Performance & Optimization

- **Audio:**
    - Use Web Audio API native nodes where available (OscillatorNode, BiquadFilterNode).
    - Throttle UI updates from knobs/sliders to prevent excessive re-render.
- **Rendering:**
    - Canvas/WebGL for dynamic visuals.
    - Avoid heavy DOM manipulation for patch cables.

### 5. Accessibility

- Every control must be operable with keyboard.
- Knobs/sliders: provide ARIA roles + labels.
- Colorblind-friendly patch cable colors.

### 6. Deployment

- Fully static build output (`npm run build`).
- Deployed via CDN (Netlify, Vercel, GitHub Pages).
- Use HTTPS and Service Worker for offline mode (optional).

### 7. Documentation

- README with local setup instructions.
- Auto-generated API docs (TypeDoc) for audio engine.
- Contribution guidelines (how to add new modules).
